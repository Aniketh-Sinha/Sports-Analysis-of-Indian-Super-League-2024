# Sports-Analysis-of-Indian-Super-League-2024
This project analyzes the Indian Super League (ISL) 2024 season by training machine learning models to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP). Key player and team performance metrics were examined to identify contributing factors. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard for exploratory data analysis, offering interactive visualizations of trends and insights.
